# Spectrum-py
`spectrum-py` is a python package to analyze FITS files containing spectra and calibrate them with associated lamps.

## How to read the name
Since the user will be doing some investigation over the properties of the spectra, the name of the package is to be 
read as "Spectrum P-Y", akin to the name of a popular tv show from the eighties.
